Tunics! rebuild for GameMaker Studio 2.

Tunics! was originally a Rogue-like Zelda fan-made quest. It means it's only dungeons, and they are randomly generated. Moreover, once you're dead, you'll have to restart from the beginning, losing all your improvements (weapons, health, etc). It should be considered a well-polished proof-of-concept.

Now, Tunics! will become it's own game, with it's own original features, and switching to GameMaker Studio 2 as the main engine.
